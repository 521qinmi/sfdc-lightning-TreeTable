# sfdc-lightning-TreeTable
TreeTable for SFDC Lightning using Lightning components & 	&lt;aura:iteration/> without the need for external 
JS libraries, or HTML lists (	&lt;ul> & &lt;li>).

The current TreeTable has been built on over the UserRole object. You can change the desired object or fields
in the server side Apex class: RolesController.apxc.

The show/hide functionnality is based on native JS/CSS used in the .js controllers.

Make sure to have some data before you test it ;)
